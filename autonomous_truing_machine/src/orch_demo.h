 *              The implementations answer for themselves, so the acquisition runs
 *              unattended. Not a physical result.
 *
 * The choice is a property of the SESSION, not of a running one: it can only be applied
 * while the machine is idle, and applying it re-initialises the orchestrator so the whole
 * BOOT -> INITIALIZE -> READY sequence runs again against the newly selected
 * implementations. Session admission then records what actually ran (SPEC §6.2), which is
 * why this cannot make a session lie about itself: no session is in progress when it
 * changes, and the next one is admitted with the truth.
 *
 * In every other image the request is refused and the manual path is the only path, so
 * the ordinary firmware has no way to reach the synthetic implementations at all. */
