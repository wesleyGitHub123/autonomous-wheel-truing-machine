 * Arduino Nano ESP32 (u-blox NORA-W106: ESP32-S3, 16 MB flash, 8 MB PSRAM).
 *
 * Nano header label -> ESP32-S3 GPIO (from the Arduino pinout):
 *   D2=5  D3=6  D4=7  D5=8  D6=9  D7=10  D8=17  D9=18  D10=21  D11=38  D12=47  D13=48 (LED_BUILTIN)
 *   A0=1  A1=2  A2=3  A3=4  A4=11 A5=12  A6=13  A7=14   RX=44  TX=43
 *   RGB LED: red=46, green=0, blue=45 (active-low; all three are strapping pins)
 *
 * Native USB only: debug and UI transport share one link (SPEC §4.1, §12.1).
