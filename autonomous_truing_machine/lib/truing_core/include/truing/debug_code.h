/**
 * @file debug_code.h
 * Debug-channel command codes (SPEC §12.5): what TRUING_INTENT_DEBUG's `payload.debug.code`
 * selects. Development only, never in the demonstration script -- admission gates the intent
 * on debug_channel_enabled alone (operator_intent.c), never on session or state; this registry
 * is consulted only once an intent has already been admitted.
 *
 * A registry, not a dispatcher: adding a code here does not make it do anything by itself.
 * The orchestrator's intent dispatch (truing_orch_submit_intent(), orchestrator.c) is the only
 * place a code is interpreted, and it is the only place that may know what a code does.
