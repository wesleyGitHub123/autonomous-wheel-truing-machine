# Bring-up log — ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1

Hardware facts below were measured on the connected development board; nothing
in this file is assumed from a datasheet. Board on `COM4` (CH343 UART bridge),
firmware `0.1.0-phase1a`, ESP-IDF 5.4.0, image 299 KB (7.1 % of the 4 MB app
partition), 22 KB static RAM.

## 2026-09-02 — Phase 1a bring-up

### Platform (SPEC §4.1: "verify on the actual board")

| Property | Measured | Board profile expectation | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chip | ESP32-S3, silicon revision v0.2, 2 cores, features 0x12 (WiFi, BLE) | — | — |
| Flash | 16,777,216 bytes, quad (eFuse) | 16 MB | PASS |
| PSRAM | 8,388,608 bytes, octal (vendor AP, 64 Mbit, generation 3), 80 MHz, memory test OK | 8 MB | PASS |
| Module identification | consistent with **ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N16R8** | N16R8 | confirmed |

`esptool flash_id` alone cannot see module-level PSRAM (it reports only chip
features); the runtime check is the authoritative one.

### Memory placement (SPEC §9.4.1)

| Check | Measured | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Heap after boot | internal 454,935 total / 366,819 free; SPIRAM 8,388,608 total / 8,386,148 free | — |
| 1 MiB `MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM` allocation | lands in external RAM | PASS |
| Internal DMA-capable pool | 359,315 free, largest block 237,568; reserve `CONFIG_SPIRAM_MALLOC_RESERVE_INTERNAL` = 65,536 | — |
| 4092-byte `MALLOC_CAP_INTERNAL \| MALLOC_CAP_DMA` allocation | internal, DMA-capable | PASS |
| Plain `malloc(200 KiB)` with PSRAM enabled | lands in **external** RAM | evidence for invariant 2: never rely on `malloc()` placement for DMA |

### I2S channel-creation probe (SPEC §9.4.1 bring-up check 5)

With PSRAM enabled and the sdkconfig committed in this repository:

| Call | Result |
|---|---|
| `i2s_new_channel(rx, dma_desc_num=6, dma_frame_num=240)` | `ESP_OK` |
| `i2s_channel_init_std_mode(48 kHz, 24-bit data in 32-bit slots, bclk=GPIO4, ws=GPIO5, din=GPIO6)` | `ESP_OK` |
| `i2s_del_channel` | `ESP_OK` |

The known N16R8 failure mode (driver DMA allocations landing in PSRAM) does not
occur with this configuration. The probe's DMA sizing is probe-only; Phase 2
derives the real sizing from the WiFi-load stress test. No audio was captured.

### Core self-test on target

The framework-free core ran on the ESP32 against the same synthetic
implementations the host tests use: row dimensions for 32/36 spokes, fixture
configuration validation including `CALIBRATION_MISSING` for an unestablished
`L_eff`, blob encode/decode and CRC rejection, a 32-spoke synthetic
measurement pass through `WheelState` and the layout rules (FULL, then
PARTIAL_WHEEL_STATE on one rejected row, then TENSION_ABSENT), the SPEC §7.3
stale-confirmation scenario, manual and synthetic wheel navigation (SPEC §10A),
and the session header's non-real-implementation flag. **19 of 19 passed.**

### Configuration persistence (SPEC §11.5)

1. Fresh board: NVS initialised, `0/5 kinds provisioned`, reported as
   "START_TRUING would not be admissible".
2. Provisioning build (`-DTRUING_BRINGUP_PROVISION_FIXTURE_CONFIG=1`): each of
   the five SYNTHETIC fixture blobs saved to NVS and read back byte-identical
   (wheel class 105 B, solver 99 B, chain 52 B, tension model 63 B, machine
   profile 55 B). Loudly logged as fixture data, not a real wheel.
3. Plain image rebuilt from scratch, re-flashed, board rebooted: `5/5 kinds
   provisioned, 5 valid`, CRCs identical to step 2
   (`517fd042`, `5e94498c`, `91bd57e2`, `cb6e6a91`, `5e112e78`).

### Summary

`BRINGUP SUMMARY: passed=29 failed=0 | flash=ok psram=ok i2s_probe=ok nvs=ok core_selftest=ok`
(34 of 34 on the provisioning boot). Heartbeat over 20 s: free internal heap
stable at 370,051 bytes, minimum-ever free 360,603 bytes, SPIRAM free stable.

### Not verified (by design of this phase)

- No audio capture, no WiFi, no stress test (Phase 1f / 2).
- The Arduino Nano ESP32 environment **builds** (same image size) but was not
  flashed: no Nano is connected.
- No real wheel configuration exists; the board currently holds the SYNTHETIC
  fixture configuration from step 2, which must be replaced before any real
  session.

### Capture method

`tools/serial_capture.py COM4 <seconds> <outfile>` resets the board through the
CH343 auto-reset lines and records the console; raw captures are kept out of
source control.

## 2026-09-02 — Phase 1d orchestrator self-play on the DevKitC-1

Firmware `0.1.0-phase1a` + orchestrator (image 316 KB, 36 KB static RAM). After
the bring-up, `orch_demo` runs the complete Capstone 2 workflow on core 0 with
the **manual** navigation and **manual** runout implementations answered by the
auto-operator (playing the human), synthetic acoustic estimates and the
synthetic calculation double. A synthetic starting state with two spokes out of
true (lateral +0.4 mm at rim index 3, −0.3 mm at index 10).

| Observation | Value |
|---|---|
| Terminal result | `CONVERGED_GEOMETRIC_ONLY`, reason `TENSION_NOT_VERIFICATION_GRADE` (the honest Capstone 2 ceiling, SPEC §8.6.3) |
| Outer cycles run | 1 (both adjustments applied, verification re-measured as cycle 2) |
| Orchestrator steps / state transitions | 660 / 660 |
| Operator waits answered | 197 = 131 positioning confirmations (1 reference + 64 measure + 2 apply + 64 verify) + 64 runout entries + 2 adjustment confirmations |
| Tension / runout records | 64 / 64 |
| Adjustments displayed | spoke 3: −0.400 rev; spoke 10: +0.300 rev; synthetic wheel corrected to 0.000 mm at both |
| Provenance (P6) | session 1, artifact 42 with fingerprint, tension-model profile 1, chain 1, machine 1, layout FULL, 96 active rows (64 valid, 32 suspect), wheel rotation 1.767 rad operator-confirmed, `contains_non_real_implementations = 1` |
| Telemetry ring | 1248 events emitted, 0 dropped (drained every step); no intents rejected |
| Wall time | 6.6 s, dominated by console logging at 115200 baud; no settle delays were needed |
| Heap after the run | internal free 356,027 bytes, minimum-ever free 333,899 bytes |

This proves the state machine, operator-wait correlation, navigation-by-outcome,
admission, apply loop, verification and provenance on the target. It proves
nothing about truing a wheel: every measurement and every solve was synthetic.

## 2026-09-03 — Phase 1c influence artifact and real truing calculation on the DevKitC-1

Firmware `0.1.0-phase1c` (image 369 KB flash, 100 KB static RAM; the expanded
artifact accounts for 57 KB of that). Bring-up: **39 checks passed, 0 failed**
(the 29 of Phase 1a plus the 10 below). Same capture method as before.

### Artifact load and checks (SPEC 8.7, 8.11 R3, 11.4)

| Observation | Value |
|---|---|
| Golden artifact `fixture_sym32` (id 1, fingerprint `25b68917ad02f8b4…`) | loaded from flash: integrity (SHA-256 content hash), compatibility (configured expected fingerprint), shape all pass |
| Compact → expanded | 30,085 B in flash → 56,720 B in internal RAM, 86.6 ms including SHA-256 and the Fourier expansion of 32 × 32 lateral and radial columns |
| Recorded conditioning | FULL rank 32, cond 47.8; TENSION_ABSENT rank 32, cond 47.8; both ≤ max_condition_number |
| Common mode | `n_mt_identified = 0` with `T_target` present (the Phase 1b finding travels with the artifact) |
| One flipped payload bit (PSRAM copy) | rejected: ARTIFACT_INVALID / content_hash |
| Different configured expected fingerprint | rejected: incompatible |
| N_rad + 1 in the solver configuration | rejected as a shape mismatch, nothing reshaped |

### Parity with the host reference and solve cost (SPEC 14.3.5)

| Observation | Value |
|---|---|
| d_ls, 4 cases × FULL + TENSION_ABSENT | worst relative deviation 7.4e-6 against the numpy float64 reference (stated tolerance 1e-5) |
| J (row-count-normalised cost) | worst relative deviation 2.6e-7 |
| Residual + inversion, FULL (32 × 96) | 626 µs per solve |
| Residual + inversion, TENSION_ABSENT (32 × 64) | 411 µs per solve |
| Full contract solve (admission + residual + inversion + plan) | 466 µs |
| Exact linear state (u = Φ_u d, v = Φ_v d) | plan recovers −d to 1.8e-7 rev |
| Policy | unidentified n_mt → TENSION_ABSENT with MEAN_TENSION_MODEL_UNAVAILABLE recorded |

The per-cycle calculation is therefore negligible against the operator-paced
workflow; nothing in Phase 1c needs PSRAM or the second core.

### Workflow self-play on the real calculation

`orch_demo` now runs the same manual-navigation / manual-runout self-play as
Phase 1d but with the artifact-backed calculation, and the simulated wheel
answers each adjustment through the artifact's own influence model
(u += Φ_u d, v += Φ_v d). Starting state: the model's response to +0.30 rev on
spoke 3, −0.25 rev on spoke 10 and +0.15 rev on spoke 21.

| Observation | Value |
|---|---|
| Starting error | max lateral 0.221 mm (tolerance 0.10 mm) |
| Terminal result | `CONVERGED_GEOMETRIC_ONLY`, reason `MEAN_TENSION_MODEL_UNAVAILABLE` (layout TENSION_ABSENT by policy, since the artifact's common mode is unidentified) |
| Outer cycles run | 1; verification re-measured as cycle 2 |
| Plan | spoke 3 −0.300 rev, spoke 10 +0.250 rev, spoke 21 −0.150 rev: the exact inverse of the perturbation |
| Adjustments the operator was asked to apply | 15 = the 3 above plus 12 of −0.000 rev at spokes whose local lateral runout was outside tolerance (the deadband rule skips only when both the turn is below the deadband and the local runout is within tolerance) |
| Final simulated wheel | max lateral 0.0000 mm; lateral at rim indices 3 and 10 exactly 0 |
| Steps / transitions / waits answered | 725 / 725 / 223 (144 positioning, 64 runout entries, 15 adjustment confirmations) |
| Provenance | session 1, artifact 1 with the golden fingerprint, layout TENSION_ABSENT, 64 active rows (64 valid, 0 suspect), `contains_non_real_implementations = 1` |
| Telemetry ring | 1,365 events, 0 dropped; no intents rejected |
| Wall time | 7.3 s, console-bound |
| Heap after the run | internal free 292,723 bytes, minimum-ever 270,363 bytes; SPIRAM untouched by the solve |

The calculation is real and artifact-backed; the acoustic estimate is still
synthetic and the wheel is a simulation of the artifact's own linear model, so
this run proves the solver and the workflow around it, not the truing of a
physical wheel. The twelve −0.000 rev prompts are worth an owner's look: they
are what the SPEC deadband rule prescribes when a neighbour's error puts a rim
index out of tolerance, and a human operator would find them pointless.

## 2026-09-03 — Phase 1f acoustic subsystem on the DevKitC-1

Firmware `0.1.0-phase1f` (image 917 KB flash, 100 KB static RAM; the growth
over 1c is the recorded campaign excerpts compiled in as C arrays). Bring-up:
**52 checks passed, 0 failed.** Same capture method as before.

### I2S front end (SPEC §9.3, §9.4, §9.4.1)

| Observation | Value |
|---|---|
| Channel | 48 kHz, 24-bit in 32-bit slots, mono; 8 descriptors x 240 frames (960 B each, a multiple of 3, under the 4092 B limit) |
| Drain task | core 1, priority 23, separate from the DSP path (SPEC §4.5) |
| Ring | 48,000 words in PSRAM, 9,600-word pre-trigger tail |
| 200 ms capture | OK, 9,600 words returned in 2 ms, entirely from the pre-trigger tail, which is the intended behaviour when the request is no longer than the tail |
| Captured signal | every word zero: **no microphone is connected to GPIO 6, and this run verifies nothing about a transducer** |
| Live `measure_spoke_tension` | rejected / NO_ONSET_DETECTED in 1,430 ms, after commanding a 19,098 µs excitation pulse; a status, never a fabricated value |
| 1 s capture with a compute task at DSP priority on core 1 | no overrun; 20 reads, longest gap between successful reads 95,954 µs |

The longest read gap is close to the 100 ms read timeout, but each read
requests 40 ms of audio and therefore blocks for about that long, so the
figure mostly measures the request size rather than starvation. No overrun
occurred. The mandatory test in SPEC §9.4 is capture integrity under **WiFi**
load, and this build has no WiFi stack: that test is deferred to Phase 1e and
is **not** claimed here.

### Layers 2–4 against the Python reference, on target (SPEC §14.2)

Three recorded plucks from the tension-sweep campaign, compiled in as C arrays
and analysed by the same code the host tests exercise.

| Pluck | f1 (Hz) | reference | SNR (dB) | candidates / strong | T ideal-string (N) | analysis |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ts00_e2 | 423.886 | 423.886 | 45.90 | 8 / 12 | 663.7 | 17.96 s |
| ts03_e2 | 379.800 | 379.800 | 75.61 | 5 / 5 | 532.8 | 16.35 s |
| d3_e1 | 432.039 | 432.039 | 57.38 | 7 / 7 | 689.4 | 16.30 s |

Worst deviation across all three: **0.0000 Hz in f1 and 0.000 dB in SNR.**
Onset sample, gate start, window length, transform length, candidate count and
strong-peak count are identical to the reference, and every estimate is
`suspect` / `PROVISIONAL_MODE_ID` / `presumed_fundamental`. The recorded noise
floor (−70.8 dBFS rms) is rejected with `NO_ONSET_DETECTED` and yields no
tension. The DSP scratch is 6,542,832 bytes in PSRAM for a 262,144-point
transform.

Two things this does **not** show. The tensiometer read 1332.8 N for the
ts00 pluck while the ideal-string model on the fixture profile gives 664 N;
the fixture's `L_eff` is the crossing distance, which is synthetic content,
and the effective-length question of SPEC §4.4.1 remains open. And the
analysis takes **16 to 18 seconds per pluck** against roughly 0.6 s on the
host — addressed in the optimisation pass below.

## 2026-09-03 — Phase 1f DSP optimisation on the DevKitC-1

Firmware `0.1.0-phase1f` rebuilt after the optimisation pass. Bring-up still
**52 checks passed, 0 failed**, and the recorded plucks still reproduce the
Python reference exactly: worst deviation **0.0000 Hz in f1, 0.000 dB in SNR**
across all three. The acoustic scratch fell from 6,542,832 to 6,114,544 bytes.

### Per-stage, one pluck, measured in isolation on the golden window

| Stage | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Onset | 92,601 us | 61,126 us |
| Hilbert envelope | 5,988,901 us | 2,085,399 us |
| Smoothing | 4,176,555 us | 38,010 us |
| Transform | 5,809,260 us | 1,411,656 us |
| Peak finding | 125,760 us | 54,786 us |
| SNR | 26,927 us | 15,114 us |
| **Total** | **16,220,004 us** | **3,666,091 us** |

End to end through the subsystem: 17,955 ms then 3,739 ms per pluck. The first
pluck of a session costs 7,327 ms because it builds the cached tables.

### The measurements that drove it

| Micro-benchmark | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| 131,073 double cos+sin | 3,476,432 us | 2,316,407 us |
| Complex transform, 131,072 pt | 1,381,746 us | 1,093,923 us |
| Complex transform, 65,536 pt | 677,998 us | 493,508 us |

Double-precision trigonometry costs 26.5 us per cos+sin pair on this part,
which is what made three constant-length loops the dominant expense. The
micro-benchmarks improved only from the platform settings; the stage timings
improved because the loops no longer run.

A negative result worth keeping: **PSRAM at 120 MHz is 1.8x slower than at
80 MHz** on this board (131,072-point transform 1,094 to 2,092 us; a pluck 3.7
to 6.6 s). The setting is pinned at 80 MHz.

## 2026-09-03 — Phase 1e comms on the DevKitC-1

Firmware: `s3_devkit`, RAM 142,824 / 327,680, flash 1,481,298 (the WiFi stack
accounts for the jump from 929 KB).

**Bring-up: 62 of 62 checks pass, 0 fail.** Nine of them are the new wire-protocol
section; one is the SPEC 9.4 capture-under-WiFi-load check deferred from 1f.

```
--- wire protocol (SPEC 12) ---
  PASS  JSON writer completes a float frame on target
  PASS  float formatting is byte-exact with the host (newlib prints digits)
  PASS  decoded runout values parse to the same floats as on the host
  PASS  confirmation without wait_id is rejected (SPEC 12.3)
  PASS  ABORT carrying a wait_id is rejected (SPEC 12.3)
  PASS  ABORT decodes in every state it may be sent from
  PASS  current-state snapshot round-trips with its wait_id and prompt (SPEC 12.2)
  PASS  GET_CURRENT_CYCLE_PROVENANCE fits its budget for a 36-spoke wheel
  PASS  provenance frame re-parses as valid JSON on target
        provenance frame 6113 bytes of 8192 budget
```

The float checks are the point of this section and not a duplicate of the host
suite: the conversion behind `truing_json_f32()` and the `strtod()` behind number
decoding both come from the target C library, and a newlib built without
floating-point printf would emit frames that stayed valid JSON while losing every
number in them. Nothing downstream would notice. They are byte-exact here.

### Transport

```
wifi:mode : softAP (xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx)
esp_netif_lwip: DHCP server started on interface WIFI_AP_DEF with IP: 192.168.4.1
net:  SPEC 12.1 transport up. Join the network and browse to:
net:    SSID       truing-xxxxxx
net:    URL        http://192.168.4.1/
```

The passphrase is derived from the same MAC and printed beside the SSID; neither
is stored in the repository. (MAC and SSID are redacted from the captured excerpt above.)

### SPEC 9.4 — capture under WiFi load

```
drain under load: OK, load iterations 55, reads 20, max read gap 53344 us, overruns 0
WiFi-load capture: OK, frames injected 91 (1058 refused), reads 21,
                   max read gap 53344 us, overruns 0, stations associated 0
  scope: radio active at ~91 frames/s with no station associated.
         A capture under an associated client's traffic is a bench check, not this one.
```

Zero overruns with the radio transmitting, and a 53.3 ms worst read gap against
the 100 ms drain budget. **The refusals are the honest part of this result**: the
driver caps raw management-frame injection near 91/s however it is driven, and
letting it own the sequence numbers changed nothing (88 -> 91 frames). So the
radio is genuinely active but not saturated, and with no station associated there
is no TCP path in the picture. The heavier case is a bench step.

### A pre-existing watchdog, found and fixed

The first capture of this slice showed 66 task-watchdog reports per boot. The
earliest fires at 11,658 ms in `main`, during acoustic bring-up — **before WiFi
starts at 29 s** — so it predates this work and had simply never been captured
past the bring-up summary.

Cause: an acoustic analysis holds core 0 for 3.7 s (7.3 s for the first of a
session) inside one orchestrator step, so IDLE0 cannot run.

| Change | Watchdog reports per boot |
|---|---|
| Before | 66 |
| Yield every 64 steps, timeout 20 s | 6 |
| Yield every step | 0 |

The intermediate result is the instructive one. Yielding every 64 steps looks
sufficient until you notice a single step can BE a measurement: 64 steps is then
four minutes of starvation. It has to be every step, and one tick against a 3.7 s
measurement costs nothing.

The structural fix is SPEC 4.5's core split — capture is already pinned to core 1,
the analysis is not — and that is Phase 2.

## 2026-09-04 — the DSP performance delta, its cause, and both boards after it

A pluck cost 3,666 ms at the end of Phase 1f and 4,763 ms after Phase 1e, on
**both** boards, with `lib/truing_dsp` untouched between the two commits. This
run reproduced the historical figure rather than trusting the documentation:
`dc44a77` was built in a throwaway worktree, flashed to the same DevKitC-1 and
measured by the same code path, and it came back at **3,666,000 us** median over
7 repetitions. The delta was real and not stale documentation, a build-flag
change, or a different measurement method — `platformio.ini` is identical
between the two commits and `sdkconfig.defaults` differs only by the websocket
and watchdog lines.

### Isolating it

| Configuration | 131,073 double cos+sin | cfft 131,072 | cfft 65,536 | total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 1f `dc44a77` | 2,318,820 us | 1,094,070 us | 493,440 us | 3,666,000 us |
| Phase 1e `ea5f2f9` | 2,288,400 us | 1,158,700 us | **749,300 us** | 4,763,234 us |
| `ea5f2f9`, radio never started | 2,283,360 us | 1,094,020 us | 493,450 us | 3,666,001 us |
| `ea5f2f9`, radio stopped before the profile | 2,284,790 us | 1,156,900 us | 748,420 us | 4,755,871 us |

The pure-CPU trigonometry benchmark is a shade **faster** in every WiFi build, so
nothing was being preempted. And stopping the radio while leaving its allocations
in place changed nothing, so it was never the radio at all: it was where WiFi's
~512 KB of PSRAM allocations pushed the acoustic scratch. The block moved by
`0x80128`, which left its base 44 bytes into a cache line instead of 4.

Rounding the base up by **20 bytes** restored the whole 30%. `heap_caps_malloc`
promises only 4-byte alignment, so the placement had always been a lottery
decided by whatever allocated first; Phase 1f won it and Phase 1e lost it. The
alignment is now applied inside `truing_acoustic_real_init` (`5fcc74d`).

### Then: the transform is not arithmetic-bound

| Transform | us per butterfly |
|---|---|
| 4,096-pt, internal RAM (48 KB working set, cache-resident) | 0.2015 |
| 4,096-pt, PSRAM (same working set, still cache-resident) | 0.2021 |
| 131,072-pt, PSRAM (1 MB, not resident) | 0.9815 |

PSRAM is not slow when the data is cached — nearly four fifths of the big
transform is cache misses. Running the passes whose butterflies stay inside a
4096-element chunk chunk-by-chunk instead of sweeping the whole array (`bc3fa9c`)
recovers a further 16%. It is bit-identical: same butterflies, same operands,
only the miss pattern differs.

### Result, both boards, production build

| Stage | Phase 1f | after 1e | now |
|---|---|---|---|
| Onset | 61,125 us | 61,602 us | 61,406 us |
| Hilbert envelope | 2,085,466 us | 3,109,971 us | **1,692,349 us** |
| Smoothing | 38,018 us | 38,022 us | 38,185 us |
| Transform | 1,411,691 us | 1,483,675 us | **1,207,666 us** |
| Peak finding | 54,750 us | 54,993 us | 55,021 us |
| SNR | 15,114 us | 15,136 us | 15,104 us |
| **Total** | **3,666,164 us** | **4,763,399 us** | **3,069,745 us** |

Medians over repeated boots: DevKitC-1 **3,069,745 us** (5 boots, 3,069,715 to
3,070,116), Nano ESP32 **3,069,791 us** (7 boots, 3,069,697 to 3,069,929). The
two boards differ by 0.0015%.

Both: bring-up **62 of 62, 0 failed**, recorded-pluck parity worst |df1| 0.0000
Hz and worst |dSNR| 0.000 dB, zero watchdog reports, zero DMA overruns under
WiFi load. Scratch 6,114,544 -> 6,114,607 bytes (the 63 bytes of alignment
padding); no other memory change.

Net against the state this run started from, 4,763 ms to 3,070 ms, is **-35.5%**;
against the Phase 1f figure that was believed to be the optimised baseline,
**-16.3%**.

### The remaining floor

0.20 us per butterfly, versus 0.79 now. Closing it needs a compact per-block
twiddle table — the twiddles of the larger blocked passes stride the whole table
and miss on their own account — which changes the plan's storage contract and its
callers. That is a proposal, not done here. Block sizes 2048 (3,114,076 us) and
8192 (3,085,580 us) were both measured slower than 4096.

### The whole workflow, DevKitC-1

The self-play is unchanged in every respect that is not time: result
**CONVERGED_GEOMETRIC_ONLY / MEAN_TENSION_MODEL_UNAVAILABLE**, cycles_run=1,
steps=725, waits_answered=223, settle_delays=0, telemetry emitted=1365 dropped=0,
