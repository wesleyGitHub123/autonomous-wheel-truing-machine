"""Build, flash, and confirm boot - the board-specific parts of this done once, not re-derived.

The two boards need genuinely different flashing routes (CLAUDE.md has the full story): the
DevKit's CH343 bridge lets PlatformIO's own upload handle reset, but the Nano's native
USB-Serial/JTAG means `-t upload` is actively wrong there - it routes through Arduino DFU,
which can write an application but not a bootloader or partition table, reports success, and
leaves the board not booting. That distinction is the one thing worth a script: everything
else here is just doing the documented steps in order and checking the one thing a
`Hash of data verified.` does NOT tell you - whether the board is actually running.

    python tools/flash.py <env> [--port COM5] [--seconds 45] [--no-build] [--verify-only]

<env> must start with `s3_devkit` or `nano_esp32` - that prefix is how the board (and
therefore the flashing route) is chosen; anything else is refused rather than guessed at.

Boot verification always resets the board first - each board's own documented mechanism, not
a fresh flash - so `--verify-only` checks a boot happening right now, not whatever the board
logged the last time it came up. It then reads the serial console (same DTR/RTS-safe handling
as serial_capture.py / nano_serial.py - never a naive open) and looks for the bring-up
subsystem's own pass/fail line, not a heuristic:

    BRINGUP SUMMARY: passed=N failed=0

`failed=0` is required; the line existing with a nonzero failure count is still reported as a
failure. If nothing appears in the window, the Nano route runs the ROM-bootloader probe
CLAUDE.md documents (an `esptool --before no_reset chip_id` that only succeeds when the chip
never left the bootloader) to say WHY, rather than leaving "no output" unexplained.

Tool paths resolve from $USERPROFILE by default (this workspace's convention - PATH is not
reliable here) but every one of them can be overridden, so this isn't tied to one account:
