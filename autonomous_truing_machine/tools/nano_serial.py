"""Read the Nano's console without knocking it into download mode.

tools/serial_capture.py resets the DevKit by asserting RTS through the CH343 bridge - the
classic ESP auto-reset lines. That does NOT apply here: the Nano's native USB-Serial/JTAG wires
DTR straight to GPIO0, so a monitor that asserts DTR (or RTS) on open reboots the chip into the
ROM bootloader instead of showing its console (see the Nano flashing notes in CLAUDE.md). The
two boards need opposite handling, which is why this is a second small script rather than a
shared one with a board flag.

pyserial applies dtr/rts as the INITIAL line state, set before open() - the only order that
doesn't touch the pins on the way in.

Usage: python tools/nano_serial.py [seconds] [out.txt]   (pyserial; the PlatformIO penv has it)
